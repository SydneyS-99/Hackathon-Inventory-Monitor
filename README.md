## Project Purpose:
The Magic Bean Stock web app was built to combat inefficient, wasteful inventory management in large-scale restaurants. It benefits the restaurant managers who utilize it and the community alike by finding sustainable alternatives to wasting product while also reducing the amount of waste. Magic Bean Stock analyzes sales trends in conjunction with current inventory and expiration dates to minimize waste and predict future orders' timing and amounts to avoid stockouts or overordering.
